# BERT_Financial_Sentiment_Analysis

# Summary
Using Tweepy to pull data from Twitter (code source to come) and using BERT to predict daily sentiment for stocks. Will try to create a model where daily sentiment can be used as a predictor for stock price movement. Then add relevant news sources and have a sentiment index for "politics", "financial", etc.

# Idea
At the moment, using ~450'000 reviews from ~500 apps from the Google Play store to fine-tune BERT. The "star rating" of an app is useful as it allows to assign a sentiment to the review to train the model. Then will use this model on Twitter data.
